Note
There is a semantic change in the 4.8 kernel (commit
9f834ec18defc369d73ccf9e87a2790bfa05bf46) that affects apparmor policy
enforcement. Specifically it affects when the m permission bit is
checked for elf binary executables. Policy and tests within apparmor
2.12 and later have been updated to support running on pre 4.8 and 4.8+ kernels.
