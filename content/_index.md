# Quick introduction

AppArmor is an effective and easy-to-use Linux application security system.
AppArmor proactively protects the operating system and applications from
external or internal threats, even zero-day attacks, by enforcing good behavior
and preventing both known and unknown application flaws from being exploited.

AppArmor supplements the traditional Unix discretionary access control (DAC)
model by providing mandatory access control (MAC). It has been included in the
mainline Linux kernel since version 2.6.36 and its development has been
supported by Canonical since 2009.

## Installation

Many Linux distributions (e.g. Debian, Ubuntu, OpenSUSE) ship with AppArmor.

Simply run `apparmor_status` to see if your Linux distribution already has
AppArmor integrated:

    $ apparmor_status
    apparmor module is loaded.

Since it is a kernel module it is usually not something users install
themselves. Individual users and system administrators might however want to
manage the application profiles which define what each application is allowed to
do by editing the files in `/etc/apparmor.d/`.

The list of currently active profiles can be easily checked with `aa-status`.

## Checking AppArmor log messages

Each time AppArmor denies applications from doing potentially harmful operations
the event is logged. Depending on your system the AppArmor events can be seen in
the syslog, auditd, kernel log or in journald logs.

Example:

    $ sudo journalctl -fx
    audit[13172]: AVC apparmor="ALLOWED" operation="open"
    profile="libreoffice-soffice"
    name="/home/otto/.mozilla/firefox/ov37570l.default/cert8.db"
    pid=13172 comm="soffice.bin" requested_mask="w"
    denied_mask="w" fsuid=1001 ouid=1001

Desktop systems that have the tool `aa-notify` installed can show events as
graphical notifications.

## Debugging application problems

When debugging issues, the first step should always be to disable the AppArmor
profile for the application and check if it had an effect. If not, the problem
in the application was not related to AppArmor.
